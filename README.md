App title: ToDoList
Description:
This app has one activity in which it displays a scrollable list of ToDo items. 
On the bottom of the screen an item can be added by the user. The items are stored in a text file on the phone, in this way the items remain if the app is closed. 
The app handles switching of orientation, it preserves what the user was typing. (I think at least, I have not tested because this function in my phone is broken and the emulator is no option for me)
An item can be removed by holding the item, an item can be played aloud by clicking it.
